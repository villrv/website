Hi, my name is V. Ashley Villar! I use data-driven methods and machine learning to study the eruptions, mergers and explosions of stars. Iâ€™m especially interested in utilizing multiband light curves to understand the underlying physics of optical transients.

I am an Assistant Professor of Astronomy at Harvard University. Previously, I was the inaugeral [Mercedes Richards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_Richards) Career Development Professor at Penn State (We Are!).

Between 07/20 and 07/21, I was a Simons Junior Fellow at Columbia University and the Flatiron Institute. I received my PhD in Astronomy & Astrophysics from Harvard in 2020, where I was a NSF Graduate Research Fellow and Ford Foundation Dissertation Fellow working with Edo Berger. I graduated from MIT in 2014 where I majored in physics and minored in mathematics. I wrote my senior thesis with John Johnson and Josh Winn on asteroseismology. I was inspired to study astronomy after reading *Death by Black Hole* by Neil deGrasse Tyson.

In my spare time, I [volunteer](https://astrobites.org/), climb, and do a number of silly projects with my husband like understanding the statistics of [ghost hunting](https://medium.com/@astrovav/the-statistics-of-spirit-boxes-2cf021bf6c3) and training a neural network to [dance](https://medium.com/@astrovav/our-first-dance-a71e07ba350c) at our wedding. I am originally from Vero Beach, Florida and proudly Peruvian-American.
